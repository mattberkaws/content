What happens if there's an S3 security event and you're affected by a ransomware attack? How can you audit your logs to understand what happened, find the culprit, and lock your buckets down? Matt and Zhamara go through this simulation with the audience's help leveraging CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Amazon Athena to investigate.
