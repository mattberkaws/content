*(A Description of the episode along with any useful code snippets, images, and whatnot)*

So sometimes on Tech Tales, we have our own issues to resolve. This episode became an unplanned Part 1 of 2 after our guest Gopi had issues sharing his screen. We pushed his demo to Part 2 and instead collaborated with chat to build some new PartyRock apps and review retreival augmented generation (RAG).
