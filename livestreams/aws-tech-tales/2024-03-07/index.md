*(A Description of the episode along with any useful code snippets, images, and whatnot)*

Zhamara and guest host Thomas hear Madhav's tale on his customer issue on needing to encypt a bucket with different keys at the prefix level rather than the bucket level. He covers that as of Jan 2023, all buckets are encrypted by S3 by default (SSE-S3). In his demo he goes through the solution he built to enforce prefix level KMS keys on S3.
